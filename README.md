# Backend REST API Boilerplate that uses Node and Loopback

If you are looking to design, develop, and impliment a REST API, then using [loopback](https://loopback.io/) is a great library to use to accomplish this.

The purpose on this project is to iterate on some of the most common endpoint patterns for backend REST API's that can connect to any datasource using loopback.
